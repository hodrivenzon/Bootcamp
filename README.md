## Car Detection and traffic forecasting
My main project is object detection for traffic forecasting based on public broadcasting cameras online.

### Example of car detection:

For each screen snapshot I count the number of cars detected and save it to a Time Series dataframe.

### Example for car count time series:

I'm data mining this information and hopfully in the near future I'll be able to forecast future traffic problems.
